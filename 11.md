Relay Information Document
--------------------------

`draft` `optional`

Relays may provide server metadata to clients to inform them of capabilities, administrative contacts, and various server attributes.  This is made available as a JSON document over HTTP, on the same URI as the relay's websocket.

When a relay receives an HTTP(s) request with an `Accept` header of `application/nostr+json` to a URI supporting WebSocket upgrades, they SHOULD return a document with the following structure.

```json
{
  "name": <string identifying relay>,
  "description": <string with detailed information>,
  "banner": <a link to an image (e.g. in .jpg, or .png format)>,
  "icon": <a link to an icon (e.g. in .jpg, or .png format>,
  "pubkey": <administrative contact pubkey>,
  "contact": <administrative alternate contact>,
  "supported_nips": <a list of NIP numbers supported by the relay>,
  "software": <string identifying relay software URL>,
  "version": <string version identifier>
}
```

Any field may be omitted, and clients MUST ignore any additional fields they do not understand. Relays MUST accept CORS requests by sending `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`, and `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` headers.

Field Descriptions
------------------

### Name

A relay may select a `name` for use in client software.  This is a string, and SHOULD be less than 30 characters to avoid client truncation.

### Description

Detailed plain-text information about the relay may be contained in the `description` string.  It is recommended that this contain no markup, formatting or line breaks for word wrapping, and simply use double newline characters to separate paragraphs.  There are no limitations on length.

### Banner

To make nostr relay management more user friendly, an effort should be made by relay owners to communicate with non-dev non-technical nostr end users. A banner is a visual representation of the relay. It should aim to visually communicate the brand of the relay, complementing the text `Description`. [Here is an example banner](https://image.nostr.build/232ddf6846e8aea5a61abcd70f9222ab521f711aa545b7ab02e430248fa3a249.png) mockup as visualized in Damus iOS relay view of the Damus relay.

### Icon

Icon is a compact visual representation of the relay for use in UI with limited real estate such as a nostr user's relay list view. Below is an example URL pointing to an image to be used as an icon for the relay. Recommended to be squared in shape.

```jsonc
{
  "icon": "https://nostr.build/i/53866b44135a27d624e99c6165cabd76ac8f72797209700acb189fce75021f47.jpg",
  // other fields...
}
```

### Pubkey

An administrative contact may be listed with a `pubkey`, in the same format as Nostr events (32-byte hex for a `secp256k1` public key).  If a contact is listed, this provides clients with a recommended address to send encrypted direct messages (See [NIP-17](17.md)) to a system administrator.  Expected uses of this address are to report abuse or illegal content, file bug reports, or request other technical assistance.

Relay operators have no obligation to respond to direct messages.

### Contact

An alternative contact may be listed under the `contact` field as well, with the same purpose as `pubkey`.  Use of a Nostr public key and direct message SHOULD be preferred over this.  Contents of this field SHOULD be a URI, using schemes such as `mailto` or `https` to provide users with a means of contact.

### Supported NIPs

As the Nostr protocol evolves, some functionality may only be available by relays that implement a specific `NIP`.  This field is an array of the integer identifiers of `NIP`s that are implemented in the relay.  Examples would include `1`, for `"NIP-01"` and `9`, for `"NIP-09"`.  Client-side `NIPs` SHOULD NOT be advertised, and can be ignored by clients.

### Software

The relay server implementation MAY be provided in the `software` attribute.  If present, this MUST be a URL to the project's homepage.

### Version

The relay MAY choose to publish its software version as a string attribute.  The string format is defined by the relay implementation.  It is recommended this be a version number or commit identifier.

Extra Fields
------------

### Server Limitations

These are limitations imposed by the relay on clients. Your client
should expect that requests exceed these *practical* limitations
are rejected or fail immediately.

```jsonc
{
  "limitation": {
    "max_subscriptions": 300,
    "max_limit": 5000,
  },
}
```

- `max_subscriptions`: total number of subscriptions that may be
active on a single websocket connection to this relay. Authenticated clients with a (paid) relationship to the relay
may have higher limits.

- `max_limit`: the relay server will clamp each filter's `limit` value to this number.
This means the client won't be able to get more than this number
of events from a single subscription filter. This clamping is typically done silently
by the relay, but with this number, you can know that there are additional results
if you narrow your filter's time range or other parameters.
